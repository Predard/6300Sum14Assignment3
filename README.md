Unit Converter

This application allows a user to select one of three modules that would allow them to do convertions of units for:

Distance - between miles and kilometers 
Weight - between Pounds and Kilograms 
Temperature - between Farenheit and Celsius 

Once the module has been selected, the user needs to type the number of the desired 
unit and select one of the buttons to convert to: 

Example: 

-if the user types 32 and then select Celcius, the application will assume that the typed numbers 
are in Farenheit and calculate the equivalent temperature in Celcius

This application requires appcompat library to compile properly.
